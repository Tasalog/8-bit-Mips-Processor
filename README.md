# 8-bit MIPS Processor

This is a repository for an 8-bit MIPS (Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipeline Stages) processor implementation. The project aims to provide a basic understanding of how a simple MIPS processor works and serves as a learning resource for computer architecture enthusiasts.

## Features

- Implementation of an 8-bit MIPS processor.
- Supports a subset of MIPS instructions.
- Provides a simulation environment to test and execute MIPS assembly code.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To use this project, you need to have the following:

- A computer with a compatible operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
- A working installation of a Verilog simulator (e.g., Icarus Verilog, ModelSim, etc.).
- Basic knowledge of computer architecture and Verilog hardware description language.

### Installation

To get started with the 8-bit MIPS Processor project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
 ```git clone https://github.com/Tasalog/8-bit-Mips-Processor.git```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```cd 8-bit-Mips-Processor```

3. Set up and configure your preferred Verilog simulator. Refer to the documentation of your simulator for detailed instructions.

## Usage

1. Open the .circ file in logism 
2. Run the program

## Supported Instructions

The 8-bit MIPS Processor currently supports the following instructions:

- `add`: Addition
- `sub`: Subtraction
- `and`: Bitwise AND
- `or`: Bitwise OR
- `slt`: Set Less Than
- `beq`: Branch if Equal
- `bne`: Branch if Not Equal
- `lw`: Load Word
- `sw`: Store Word

For a complete list of instructions and their details, refer to the MIPS instruction set documentation.
